In this project, I am working as a data analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust. My task is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features. 
I have used data wrangling to drop unnecessary columns and deal with null values. Use the seaborn library to visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the predictor variable.
I built a baseline Linear Regression model and refined it by using Standard Scaler, Polynomial Features and Ridge Regression to get a higher R2 score.

Thank you for viewing my project!
